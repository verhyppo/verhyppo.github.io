# ðŸª´ First Mile in sw development

## Just after university and Internship

## First Software Development steps

Between 2013 and 2016, I worked as a backend developer at INQ Mobile on behalf of FullMobile. 
We worked on a primordial Artificial Intelligence able to perform Interest Extraction from users' social profiles. To do so, we worked with a lot of open source products, such as Apache Solr, Apache Tomcat, ElasticSearch, CouchDB, MySQL. Lots of programming languages: Java, the most used, Python, Scala, Javascript. Here I started my long journey in software quality, maintaining and following all test phases of the product lifecycle.

After this experience, within the same team, I developed, among with my team an MVP for Hutchison Whampoa Group: a Recommendation Engine and user interests profiling system. 
Mainly, I was involved as a full stack developer, creating the infrastructure for data synchronization, extraction and visualization, spacing from frontend to DB technologies (AngularJS, Spring, MongoDB, RDBMS (Amazon RDS), Hibernate). 

## Mid Developer Road

Since October 2016, I started working as IT Consultant at IGT on behalf of Ringmaster as a Full Stack Developer on a Real-Time Gamification System.
I have covered a key role in the development, delivery, performance, functional testing and analysis of multiple R&D projects. Main technologies were Spring, Camel, Drools, Infinispan, MongoDB, AngularJS, Elasticsearch

During this experience, I had, not just the ability to improve my skills, but also understand what was the road I wanted to explore: *being a software architect.*
