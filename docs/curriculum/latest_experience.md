# ðŸ’¼ Since 2019

## Konica Minolta
Since December 2018, I lived a huge change in my career.

My current role is Software Architect and DevSecOps curator and advisor to the development teams.

Before that, I was a Software Engineer, covering also the role of Tech Leadership moving from Software craftmanship to a role that was more oriented in connecting the dots, which allowed me to evaluate the gaps and help teams work together.

At the very beginning, as a software developer inside a Scrum Team at Konica Minolta, I have worked on multiple projects based on document manipulation and metadata extraction we enhanced the contents provided to the end-users. Main technologies are: Springboot, VueJs, AngularX, PostgresSQL, Elasticsearch, AngularJS, RabbitMQ, Docker, K8s, CI/CD tools (e.g. Jenkins)

## Recent interests

### Open Source Software

During the last few years, I matured a deep love for maintaining and improving open source software. 
Mainly, when I find a project that triggers my curiosity, I fork it and start contributing to it, usually older projects that need versions upgrades, security fixes, or new features, that I need too!

### Security hardening and exploitation

For the last 6 months I have been working hard on experimenting and deeply understanding the practices to secure complex systems.

### Architecture as a lifestyle

Designing and defining architectural decisions is a very important part of my career and I have been doing it for a long time, even before I was responsible to do so.
Generally, I really like to explore the different ways to implement ideas and solutions by evaluating all aspects of them and seeing how they can be applied to different projects and products.
